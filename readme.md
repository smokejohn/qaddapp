# QAddApp

QAddApp is a little GUI Application that helps you integrate AppImages and binaries
into your Linux desktop environment. It provides a User Interface which helps you 
create a .desktop file and places the applications in a location of your choice.
It can also create symlinks to a folder in your $PATH for you so you can execute
the app via commandline from any location.

## Installation
Get the latest AppImage from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/smokejohn/qaddapp/releases).

You might have to change the permissions of the AppImage to be able to start the app
``` bash
chmod u+x QAddApp-x86_64.AppImage
```

You can then start QAddApp by double clicking the AppImage or if you are in the commandline
and already in the folder the AppImage is you can use this command to launch it.
``` bash
./QAddApp-x86_64.AppImage
```

Feel free to use QAddApp to integrate it itself into your Desktop Environment!  
A Desktop Icon file can be found at the [Releases Page](https://github.com/smokejohn/qaddapp/releases).
